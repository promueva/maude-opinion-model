# Experiments Gossip Model

The directory contains the files used for the experiments on the gossip model 
and the scripts to reproduce them: 

For these experiments, randomly generated networks were used. The generated
Maude files are `2.maude` - `43.maude`. 

The script `./generate-gossip.py` can be used to generate cliques of _n_
agents. The script `./test-gossip.sh` can be used to run in batch the
experiments.
